# handbags

# What it does
In this project, I created four webpages: the index.html page (with a menu link to the handbags page), the handbags page (each handbag has a link to the handbag-details page), handbag-details page (gives details about the specific handbag that one selects) and the add to cart page (where if one likes any of the handbags, one can click on the add to cart button and buy the bag). The goal of this project is to ensure that each of these pages should have versions for 2 different screen sizes (mobile & tablet: up to 1024px and desktop: from 1024px) with colors, typographies and layout from <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/69329213/Flower-e-shop"> Design Page </a>.
